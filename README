# ETime

An clean program to help you see the execution time.

## Why it comes

I was using [ptime](https://www.pc-tools.net/win32/ptime/) to build my environment for competitive programming. But there's one problem that it will show the copyright **AND IT CANNOT BE CANCELED.**

So here's my own edition.

## Using

`etime program [args]`

After typing this, the program will run at once. And then you'll get an message:

`execution time: *.***s`.

## Building

Just say `make` and it done.
